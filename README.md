# BARThez
A french sequence to sequence pretrained model.

## Introduction
A french sequence to sequence pretrained model based on [BART](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/bart). <br>
BARThez is pretrained by learning to reconstruct a corrupted input sentence. A corpus of 66GB of french raw text is used to carry out the pretraining. <br>
Unlike already existing BERT-based French language models such as CamemBERT and FlauBERT, BARThez is particularly well-suited for generative tasks, since not only its encoder but also its decoder is pretrained. 

In addition to BARThez that is pretrained from scratch, we continue the pretraining of a multilingual BART [mBART](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/mbart) which boosted its performance in both discriminative and generative tasks. We call the french adapted version mBART_fr.

| Model         | Architecture  | #layers | #params | Link  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| BARThez       | BASE          | 12     | 216M  | [Link]() |
| mBARThez      | LARGE         | 24     | 561M  |[Link]() |

## Summarization
Thanks to its encoder-decoder structure, BARThez can perform generative tasks such as summarization. In the following, we provide an example on how to fine-tune BARThez on title generation in OrangesSum:  

#### Install fairseq
```
git clone https://github.com/moussaKam/BARThez
cd BARThez/fairseq
pip install --editable ./
```

#### Sentencepiece Tokenization
Install sentencepiece from [here](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) <br> 
Encode the data using `spm_encode`. In total there will be 6 files to tokenize. <br>
You can refer to `summarization_data_title_barthez/encode_spm.sh` script. 

#### Data binarization. 
To be able to use the data for training, it should be first preprocessed using `fairseq-preprocess`. <br>
Refer to `summarization_data_title_barthez/binarize_summarization.sh` script.

#### Train the model.
It's time to train the model.  <br> 
Use the script in `BARThez/experiments/title_generation/barthez_summarization_title.sh` <br> 
The Training takes roughly 3 hours on 1GPU TITAN RTX.
